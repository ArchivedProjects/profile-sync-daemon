BUILDING YOURSELF
 Several options are present in the Makefile. Most users can safely  ignore them
 leaving the defaults. User of NixOS not using the distro provided package for
 psd should enable the NIXOS_MAN option to get a NixOS customized man page for
 example.

 Setup the via a make.

 $ make

 Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to the file-
 system.  Most users will want to select from three options depending on target
 init system (do not run all three)!

 # make install-openrc-all
 # make install-systemd-all
 # make install-upstart-all

CAVEATS POST-INSTALL/PLEASE READ THIS SECTION

 UPSTART USERS
 As a friendly reminder for users of upstart, you will need to enable
 the daemon manually if you built psd manually since I no longer supply
 psd pre-packaged for non-systemd versions of Ubuntu/Debian/Mint and clones
 (see my explanation in the section below for context).

 To enable psd for upstart:
 # update-rc.d psd defaults

 To disable psd for upstart:
 # update-rc.d -f psd remove

 OPENRC USERS
 Special note for OpenRC users - An OpenRC service script is included and will
 be installed to: /usr/share/doc/profile-sync-daemon/psd.openrc

 You will need to:
 1) Verify the path to openrc-run on your distro in the shebang.
 2) Copy the script to your distro's OpenRC's script directory.
 3) Chmod it to 755.

 Gentoo uses: /sbin/openrc-run so the shebang is: #!/sbin/openrc-run
 Arch uses: /usr/bin/openrc-run so the shebang is: #!/usr/bin/openrc-run

 If in doubt, you may simply execute the following command and use the output
 as your location: which openrc-run

 I have chosen this route since:
 1) I do not run OpenRC or Upstart.
 2) I do not follow their respective development.
 3) Different distros use different paths to required executables (see above).
 4) Both OpenRC and Upstart are unofficially supported for some distros, so even
 on the same distro, there can be different paths to the required service scripts
 (see the Arch Linux Wiki page on OpenRC for examples).

 All these make it impractical for me to maintain pre-packaged versions of psd
 for these init systems in my PPA (see below).

 As of v5.29, systemd installations no longer install the deprecated cron script
 instead using a systemd timer. Users may override and install the deprecated
 cron script by running: `make install-cron` then `make install-systemd-all` if
 desired. The cron script is only deprecated for systemd installs; it is still
 recommended for users of both upstart or openrc.

USE A DISTRO PROVIDED PACKAGE
 ARCH LINUX
 Arch users may build the package directly with the provided PKGBUILD:
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/profile-sync-daemon

 CHAKRA
 Chakra users may build the package directly with the provided PKGBUILD:
 http://chakra-linux.org/ccr/packages.php?ID=5008

 DEBIAN/UBUNTU
 Debian/Ubuntu users may use the PPA graysky maintains at this url:
 https://launchpad.net/~graysky/+archive/utils

 Note that your system MUST be using systemd as the init system. I believe this
 to be true for the following:
 Debian 8.0+
 Mint 18.0+ ???
 Ubuntu 15.04+

 EXHERBO
 Exherbo users can build the package directly with the provided ebuild here:
 http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/net-www/profile-sync-daemon

 FEDORA
 Fedora users may use the official Fedora repositories to install psd. Approval
 has been granted for inclusion on 01-Jun-2013[1].
 1. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=968253

 GENTOO
 Gentoo users can build the package directly with the provided ebuild:
 http://packages.gentoo.org/package/www-misc/profile-sync-daemon

 NIXOS
 Users of NixOS <14.12 (currently unreleased) MUST be tracking nixos-unstable;
 this will change once version 14.12 is finalized:

 nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixos
 nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade

 Now add the following to your configuration.nix:

 services.psd = {
   enable = true; users = [ "facade" "debbie" ]; # At least one users
   browsers = [ "chromium" "firefox" ]; # Leave blank to enable all
   useOverlayFS = true; # set to true to enable overlayfs
 };

 Finally, rebuild with: the nixos-rebuild switch.

 VOID LINUX
 Void users can download the package directly from the official repos.
