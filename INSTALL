USE A DISTRO PROVIDED PACKAGE
 ARCH LINUX
 Arch Linux users may, use the PKGBUILD in the AUR at this url:
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/profile-sync-daemon

 GENTOO
 Gentoo users can build the package directly with the provided
 ebuild:
 http://packages.gentoo.org/package/www-misc/profile-sync-daemon

 FEDORA
 Fedora 18 users may use prepackaged rpms maintained by graysky
 at the following url: http://repo-ck.com/fedora_rpms

 DEBIAN/MINT/UBUNTU
 Debian/Mint/Ubuntu users may use the PPA graysky maintains at this url: 
 https://launchpad.net/~graysky/+archive/utils
 Or build themselves using the included Makefile.ubuntu and debian
 build tools such as dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage. Note in this 
 case the scripts in common/debian.  Of particular interest is 
 the fact that Ubuntu/Debian use different paths for both their 
 lock files and for their default mounted tmpfs paths. See 
 common/debian/postinst for the changes.
