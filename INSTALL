* Makefile.archlinux is setup for Archlinux.  
* Makefile.gentoo is setup for Gentoo.
* Makefile.ubuntu is setup for Debian/Ubuntu.
* Makefile.fedora18 is setup for Fedora 18 and is identical
  to the Arch Linux Makefile.

There is no configure script nor is there anything to compile.
Copy or symlink the Makefile.x of your chosing to Makefile.

 $ ln -s Makefile.archlinux Makefile

Setup the via a make.

 $ make

Running a `make install` as root will distribute the files to
the filesystem.

 # make install

It is highly discouraged to manually build this on Arch Linux.
Instead, use the PKGBUILD in the AUR so the resulting package
can be managed by pacman:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/profile-sync-daemon

Ubuntu/Debian users may use the PPA graysky maintains at this url: 
https://launchpad.net/~graysky/+archive/utils
Or build themselves using the included Makefile.ubuntu and debian
build tools such as dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage. Note in this 
case the scripts in common/debian.  Of particular interest is 
the fact that Ubuntu/Debian use different paths for both their 
lock files and for their default mounted tmpfs paths. See 
common/debian/postinst for the changes.
