Makefile.archlinux is setup for Archlinux.  
Makefile.ubuntu is setup for Debian/Ubuntu.
Makefile.gentoo is setup for Gentoo.

There is no configure script nor is there anything to compile.
Copy or symlink the Makefile.x of your chosing to Makefile.

Setup the via a make.

 $ make

Running a `make install` as root will distribute the files to
the filesystem.

 # make install

It is highly discouraged to manually build this on Arch Linux.
Instead, use the PKGBUILD in the AUR so the resulting package
can be managed by pacman:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/profile-sync-daemon

Ubuntu/Debian users may use the PPA graysky maintains or build
themselves using the included Makefile.ubuntu and the debian
build tools such as dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage.
Note in this case the scripts in common/debian.  Of particular
interest is the fact that Ubuntu/Debian use different paths
for both their lock files and for their default mounted
tmpfs paths. See common/debian/postinst for the changes.
