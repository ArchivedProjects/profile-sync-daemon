Makefile is setup for Archlinux.  
Makefile.ubuntu is setup for Debian/Ubuntu.

There is no configure script nor is there anything to compile.
Running a `make install` will file unless you do so as root.
Doing so with the Makefile included will install an Arch Linux
setup on your machine. It is highly discouraged to manually build
this on Arch Linux. Instead, use the PKGBUILD in the AUR:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/profile-sync-daemon

Ubuntu/Debian users may use the PPA graysky maintains or build
it yourself using the included Makefile.debian and the debian
build tools such as dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage.

If you wish to contribute to other distros, fork this project
on github and submit a pull request:
