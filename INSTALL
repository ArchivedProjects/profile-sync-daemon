BUILDING
 There is no configure script nor is there anything to compile.
 Copy or symlink the Makefile.x of your choosing to Makefile.

  $ ln -s Makefile.archlinux Makefile

 * Makefile.archlinux is setup for Archlinux.  
 * Makefile.exherbo is setup for Exherbo. 
 * Makefile.fedora18 is setup for Fedora 18 and Rawhide.
 * Makefile.gentoo is setup for Gentoo.
 * Makefile.ubuntu is setup for Debian/Mint/Ubuntu.

 Setup the via a make.

  $ make

 Running a `make install` as root will distribute the files to
 the file system.

  # make install

 As of v5.29, the Makefiles for systemd-native distros such as 
 Arch, Exherbo, and Fedora, no longer install the deprecated 
 cron script using a systemd timer instead. Users may override 
 and install the deprecated cron script by running make with 
 `install-with-cron` instead  of `install` at this point.

USE A DISTRO PROVIDED PACKAGE
 ARCH LINUX
 Arch Linux users may, use the PKGBUILD in the AUR at this url:
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/profile-sync-daemon

 DEBIAN/MINT/UBUNTU
 Debian/Mint/Ubuntu users may use the PPA graysky maintains at 
 this url: https://launchpad.net/~graysky/+archive/utils
 Or build themselves using the included Makefile.ubuntu and debian
 build tools such as dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage. Note in this 
 case the scripts in common/debian.  Of particular interest is 
 the fact that Ubuntu/Debian use different paths for both their 
 lock files and for their default mounted tmpfs paths. See 
 common/debian/postinst for the changes.

 EXHERBO
 Exherbo users can build the package directly with the provided
 exhere: 
 http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/net-www/profile-sync-daemon

 FEDORA
 Fedora 18 users may use prepackaged rpms maintained by graysky
 at the following url: http://repo-ck.com/fedora_rpms

 GENTOO
 Gentoo users can build the package directly with the provided
 ebuild:
 http://packages.gentoo.org/package/www-misc/profile-sync-daemon
 
 A special note for Gentoo users on this topic: the gentoo
 Makefile (and corresponding ebuild) supply both the service
 files AND the cronjob in /etc/cron.hourly/psd-update HOWEVER,
 /etc/cron.hourly/psd-update is installed by default 644 so that
 it cannot execute with you manually chmod'ing it to +x.

 OPENSUSE
 OpenSUSE users are free to make use of a user supported repo hosting
 the package:
 http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/Overman79:/Laptop
